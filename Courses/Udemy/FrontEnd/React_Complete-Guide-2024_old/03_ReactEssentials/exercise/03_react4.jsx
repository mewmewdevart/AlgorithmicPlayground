// Reacting to Events
// Your task is to work on a "User Login" component that has already been prepared by a colleague.

// The goal is to update the data stored in the already existing user object with some dummy data once the "Login" button in the App component is pressed.

// The email and password properties in the user object should be set to any non-empty string values of your choice. The loggedIn field should be set to true.

// Important: You don't have to fetch the values entered into the <input> fields - you can simply ignore those fields for now. You'll learn how to listen to keystrokes and get user input later in the course.

// Your goal is to change the email, password and loggedIn values when the button in the App component is pressed
// Change them to any values of your choice (except loggedIn => that should be changed to true)
// You DON'T need to fetch the values entered into the <input /> fields
// You'll learn about that later in the course - for the moment, those fields are just there to look good :-)
export const user = {
    email: '',
    password: '',
    loggedIn: false,
  };
  
  // Please note: The login does not actually work!
  // This exercise is just about practicing event handling
  // You'll learn how to add user authentication to React apps later in the course!
