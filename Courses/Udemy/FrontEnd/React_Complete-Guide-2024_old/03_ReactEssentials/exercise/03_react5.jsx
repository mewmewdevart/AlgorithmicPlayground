// Configuring Event Handlers
// Your task is to edit the <button> in the App component such that the already defined handleCreateUser function is called with a value for name.

// So you must not hard-code the value that should be assigned to user.name in the handleCreateUser function but instead pass it as a value for the name parameter when a click event on the <button> occurs.

// You don't have to care about any value that might be entered into the <input> field - it's just there for decoration purposes.

export const user = {
    name: '',
  };
  
  function App() {
    // Your goal: This function should be called WITH A VALUE for name when the <button> is clicked
    function handleCreateUser(name) {
      user.name = name;
    }
  
    return (
      <div id="app">
        <h1>User Login</h1>
        <p>
          <label>Name</label>
          {/* You don't need to do anything with this input! You'll learn how to handle user input later */}
          <input type="text" />
        </p>
  
        <p id="actions">
          <button onClick={() => handleCreateUser("Larissa")}>Create User</button>
        </p>
      </div>
    );
